TLDR; do TODOs and include linked list stuff
>two threads: thread #1 (T1) allocates space for pointer p to hold THREADDATA
	      thread #2 (T2) deallocates space in pointer p which holds THREADDATA
	-use template code provided: main2_a5.c

>protect critical section of malloc using locks:
	-T2 checks if p is set to NULL before performing deallocation
	-call malloc before going to T2
>protect critical section of free using locks
	-set p = NULL before going to T1

>T1 reads lines in from user and saves into new node in linked list
	-use fgets(buf, 100, stdin) to read lines (limit 20 char)
	-(while loop)stop when empty line (char=0 or \n?) or Ctrl+C

>T2 prints content of first node when content changes (from T1)
	-protect critical section reading and updating first node

>T2 exits when T1 which reads lines is complete
	-set reading_complete flag

>Both threads print messages to stdout
	-"Logindex 1, thread 2, PID 5435, 21/04/2020 09:23:25 pm:  Head of linked list contains line foo".
	-time can be taken from template code: time.c

>log index is shared between threads
	-employ protectio similar to allocation and deallocation of THREADDATA pointer
	-mutex locking?

compile code with:
gcc -D_REENTRANT -pthread -o thread_manager thread_manager.c

utilize valgrind to check for memory leaks
